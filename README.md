# clustering-analysis
Seismicity clustering analysis based on nearest neighbor distances of event pairs

This repository is an implementation of Zaliapin & Ben-Zion in python.

When using this code, please cite:
- Zaliapin, I., and Ben-Zion, Y., 2013, Earthquake clusters in southern California I: Identification and stability: Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, v. 118, no. 6, p. 2847â€“2864, doi: 10.1002/jgrb.50179.
and
- Goebel, T.H.W., Rosson, Z., Brodsky, E.E., and Walter, J.I., 2019, Aftershock deficiency of induced earthquake sequences during rapid mitigation efforts in Oklahoma: EPSL, v. submitted.

The provided codes reproduce Figures 4, 5 and 8 in the paper, as well as general
productivity and aftershock rate plots for Southern California.

The analysis is based on a relocated earthquake catalog from Hauksson et al. 2012 from 1981 to 2011,
available at: http://scedc.caltech.edu/research-tools/altcatalogs.html

The two files provides are: hs_1981_2011_all.mat
in matlab binary format which can be loaded using scipy.io.loadmat

and the catalog in original format:
hs_1981_2011_all.txt 
with the data columns:
#YR   MO DY HR MN SC          N     Lat         Lon      Depth   MAG  NP Dist  rms   d_n meth clID  nCl     ndTT  err_h   err_z   err_h2  err_z2 type  meth2  poly                  

following python modulus have to be installed before using the code:
numy, scipy
mx.DateTime: https://pypi.org/project/egenix-mx-base/

Code has been developed and tested on unix/linux systems and will not work on windows without modification.
Specifically, paths to directories will have to be adjusted to windows as well as using 'gawk' and 'sed' in
the module 'EqCat'.

GETTING STARTED:
1) download the earthquake catalog (hs_1981_2011_all.mat matlab binary file)
2) run the script: 1b_preprocess_testPlot.py and check if the catalog is plotted corretly above M3.
3) ...TODO: (determine eta_0 ...)
4) find neatest neighbor using NND (eta) for each event: 3_NND.py
